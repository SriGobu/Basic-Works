<!-- External Libraries , MVC , Finish the checkout page -->
<!-- 
External Libraries
=> code that is outside of our project
=> other developers
        ||
    internet JS
        ||
    our project JS
=> a lot of developers write javaScript code and 
=> then put thier code on the intenet
=> we can actually load their code from the internet
=> into our project and use it 

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev@1.0.1/hello.js"></script>

=> inside the script tag that src contains a external library's url 
=> without internet the external library will not work
=> first we have to load the external libraray and then our local file
=> why we use external libraries
=> let us share code
=> save time
=> avoid duplicating work

=> example in our checkout page
=>in the choose a deliveryoption
=> to get these days
=> get today's date
=> do calculations (add 7 days)
=> display the date in easy to read format
=> we can do it by ourself but 
=> by using external library it will save many work

=> compressing the javaScript file is called minification like DayJS library

=> how to use dayjs 
=> dayjs external libraries usually have a documentation page that shows how to use
=> we can find the documentation page by searching on googel the library name like dayjs documentation
=> in the dayjs documentation dayjs() is to get today date 
=> add has two parameter
=> first => number of time we want to add
=> second => length of time we want to add
=> for 7 days 
=> const a = dayjs()
=> const b = a.add(7,'day') => is for 7 days

=> dayjs().format() => which will display the date in a easy to read foramt
=> dayjs().foramt('') => inside the string tells what kind of format we want for the date
=> dddd => sunday - saturday 
=> MMMM => january - december
=> D => 1-31
=> this method takes the string and convert it into a string we want
console.log(deliveryDate.format('dddd, MMMM, D'));

=> when we need something complicated 
=> try to find an external library first 
=> before writing the code our self

=> to find many documentation or library 
=> in google javaScript date library

=> External Libraries + JavaScript Module
=> we used script => src => url => external library 
=> by loding it like this if we have same name as the function in the hello
=> it will cause naming conflict 
=> a module will contain this code inside a file 
=> any variables that are created inside the file will not conflict with anything outside of the file
=> to combine the External Libraries + JavaScript Module 
=> we have to use the special version of the library called ESM version
=> ESM => EcmaScript Module ( EcmaScript = javaScript )
=> ESM version 
=> A version of a library is just a version that works with javScript modules
import {hello} from 'https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev@1.0.1/hello.esm.js'
=> in the hello function ESM file we have the export method
=> now we are importing the hello fundtion from the ESM module by the use of its url

=> import dayjs from 'https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev@8.5.0/dayjs/esm/index.js'
=> now we are using the ESM file of the dayjs

=> import dayjs from 
=> dayjs => this is called as default export 
=> a default export is another way of exporting
=> we can use it when we only want to export 1 thing
=> we can use it when we only want to exposrt one thing from a file 
=> it makes the syntax cleaner and easy to use

=> export default formatCurrency;
=> import formatCurrency from './utils/money.js';
=> we can just import the name without the curly brackets 
=> so the syntax is a little bit cleaneer
=> each file can only have 1 default export
=> if we only want to export one thing from a file
=> this is another syntax we can use
=> so some people like using default exports because 
=> they feel that exporting only one thing from a file makes the code cleaner
=> however in your own code it's upto you which version of export you want to use

=>import { products } from '../data/products.js';
=> { products } => this is called as named export 
=> not every library has the ESM file 
=> in that case we hev to use the script tag

<!-- 
Update the data
Regenerate all the HTML 
MVC => Model - View - Contoller
=> it is a propular technique in software engineering
=> in MVC 
=> we split our code into three parts
=> 1. Model => saves and manages the data
=> all the files in the data folder are called Model
=> because this code serves and manages our data
=> 2. View => takes the data and displays it on the page
=> in the checkout.js file => scroll to the top and 
=> there we have code that takes our data and then generates all the HTML 
=> this part of code is called View
=> 3. Contoller => runs some code when we interact with the page
=> in the checkout.js file => in bottom the eventListener's are called Contoller
=> becuase they do something when we interact with the page
=> instead of updating the page directly with the Dom
=> we just update our data and then regenrate all the Html
=> MVC => makes sure the page always matches the data
=> MVC => is a design pattern
=> it is a way to organize and design our code
=> in the future you might use a technology called a javaScript Framework to build websites
=> many javaScript Frameworks are based on the MVC 
=> so it is useful to know how to do it
