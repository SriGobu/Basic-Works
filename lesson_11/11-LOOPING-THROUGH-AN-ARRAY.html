    // Problem 
    // we have an array of numbers [1, 1, 3] how do we calculate the total?
    // to solve this problem we have to use the Accumulator Pattern
    // Accumulator Pattern =>
    // Create a variable to store the result
    // Loop through the array and update the result

    const nums = [1, 1, 3];
    let total = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length ; i++) {
      const num = nums[i];
      total += num ;
    }
    console.log(total);

    /*
step 1 : we have to calculate the sum of the values in the array
step 2 : so that we are using the accumulator method
step 3 : first we have to create a variable for the 'sum'
step 4 : using for loop we give a starting value, condition until run, increment value  
step 5 : then we are loop through the array nums[i] and store it in a variable 
step 6 : we are adding the variable into the first variable for the sum  
    */

    const numsDoubled = [];
    
    for (let i=0; i < nums.length ; i++) {
      const num = nums[i]
      numsDoubled.push(num * 2);
    }

    console.log(numsDoubled);
/*
step 1 : we have to double the value in the first example array
step 2 : for that we created a empty array.
step 4 : using for loop we give a starting value, condition until run, increment value  
step 5 : then we are loop through the array nums[i] and store it in a variable 
step 6 : we are adding the variable into the first variable for the sum 
step 7 : now we are pushing the doubled value from the loop throughed variable to the empty array
