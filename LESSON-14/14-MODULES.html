<!-- Modules
=> a better way to organize our code
=> problem 6 in the Amazon project code
=> open the amazon.html and go to the script tag 
=> we're using three scripts tag to run all our javaScript 
=> it runs one by one => cart.js => product.js => amazon.js
=> this is same as combining all the files together into 1 big file
=> run all our code
=> there is big problem when using the script tag like this
=> the problem is it cause the naming conflicts
=> we created a variable called  => cart = [{}] in cart.js 
=> it means we can't use the cart in any other files
=> if we went to amazon.js => create a varibale => cart = [{}] in amazon.js
=> after the declaration the website will stop working
=> in the console it will say that the cart is already declared
=> it's because we created the cart variable in two files 
=> javascript wil not support variables with the same name in javaScript 
=> it causes a error and breaks our website
=> this is called as NAMING CONFLICT
=> this happesn when two varible have the same name
=> see in amazon.js => it is really hard to tell which variables have been created in other files and
=> it is easy to accidentally create a naming conflict 
=> that's the problem will happens if we use the script tag
=> to solve this problem javaScript has a featue called modules

=> a module basically contains a variable inside a file
=> now if it is inside the file it will not cause any naming conflict outside the file

=> now in our project we created a cart variable inside the cart.js file 
=> so that it doesn't conflict with the cart varibable inside the amazon.js

=> after we deleted the cart.js file the website will run 
=> but now the naming conflict will not occur

=> Create a Module
=> Create a file
=> Don't load the file with <script>
=> any variables we create inside the file,
=> will be contaiend inside the file
=> it wont't cause the naming conflict

=> after the deletion of the cart.js file 
=> cart doesn't exist anymore
=> it is contained inside the cart.js 
=> we can't access 'cart' from the otuside

=> get a variable out of a file
=> add type="module" attribute
=> Export
=> Import

=> add type="moduele" attribute
=> in our amazon.html file in the script tag we add the type attribute
=> type="module" => this enables this below feature
=> let's this file get varibles out of other files.

=> Export
=> export const cart = [];
=> by typing the export before the cart variable 
=> by using this we can access the variable cart outside of this file
=> now the cart variable can be used outside the file

=> Import
=> import {cart} from '../data/cart.js'
=> import => is the function we used to import a file
=> {cart} => inside the curly brackets we are going to tell what variable we want
=> from => by using this we are importing the cart variable from a file
=> '' => inside of it represents the file path
that file we want 
=> .. => by using this it will get us out from the current file that we are in
=> / => by using this it will get out from the current folder that we re in
=> data => now we are going to the data folder by typing its name
=> / => by using the slash it will help us get into the file we want
=> cart.js => the file that contained the varibale we want 

==> what this code does is that it's going to take the variable cart out of the file cart.js 
=> and we use this file path here to locate that file 
=> .. means going outisde of the curent folder outside of scripts
=> then we go into the data folder
=> then inside the data folder we find cart.js

=> first => we put type="module" to enable this feature
=> second => we export the variables we want to get out
=> third => we import the variables when we need them

=> two more thing we need to learn about module
=> put all imports at the top of the file
=> we need to use live server inorder to work live server
=> the modules don't work if we directly open the HTML file

=> benifits
=> helps us avoid naming conflicts
=> import {cart} from '../data/cart.js';
   const cart =[]
=> if we type like this in a same file it will cause naming conflicts 
=> module provides a feature avoid this type of naming conflicts
=> import {cart as myCart} from '../data/cart.js';
=> we are basically import the variable by its original name
=> by typing( as myCart) it will convert the original name to an another name
=> now the cart variable will not conflict with the file
=> we don't have to worry about the order of our files

=> one script tag is must needed in a file to load the modules from other files

=> import * as cartModule from '../data/cart.js'
=> cartModule.cart
=> cartModule.addToCart('id');
=> this imports everything from a file and grups it together inside this object
=> then we access each import as a property or a  method
