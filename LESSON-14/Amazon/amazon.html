<!-- 
=> script element loaded one by one 
=> so the order matters 
=> first we have to create the products 
=> if it these two were reversed then the code woudln't 

<script src="/data/products.js"></script> 
=> this javaScript file creates all the products and then 
<script src="/scripts/amazon.js"></script>
=> this javaScript file loop through the products and creates all the HTML
-->
 <!--
=> in the real life projects we creates
=> we don't write all the HTML manually
=> instead we save the data for the website in a data structurelike the products.js
=> then by using javaScript to generate the HTML using the data
 -->
</body>
</html>

<!-- 
last => make the cart section interactive
steps =>
=> calculate the quantity
=> put the quantity on the page
=> cart is a array of objects
=> each object has the quantity property
=> loop through the array and calculate the cart

=> first we attached the data using the data attribute 
=> then we click the button 
=> we got the product name out
=> then we add the product to the cart 

=> mistake 3 =>
=> if we reclick the product again it creates a new cart
=> but what we want is add only the quantity anytime we click

=> steps 
=> check if the product is already in the cart
=> if it is in the cart increase the quantity 
=> if it is not in the cart add it to the cart  

=> mistake 4 =>
=> it is not good to use the productName to identify the product in the cart
=> in an e-commerce website we might have a tow product with same name
=> but from different brand
=> to fix this 
=> => give each product an id 
=> => thatis should be unique
=> no two products will contain the same id

=> lastlty we have put the quantity on the page
=> we need HTML element where we're going to put this quantity
