/*
forEach() method => also known as for loop 
it allows us to loop through the array
inside the brackets we're going to give forEach a function
forEach will loop through the array 
for each value it will save it in the paramter 
and runs the function

forEach() => is the preferred way to loop through an array
value => it will save the value into this value parameter
index => it will save the index of the value into the index parameter
forEach is not having  continue instead we can use return 
forEach is also having break;
if we need to use break;
then it's better to use a regular loop
