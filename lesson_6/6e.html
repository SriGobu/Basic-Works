<!-- continuing from excersice 6d let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday . create a variable : const isholiday = true ; -->

<!-- update the code so that in order to get a discount . people must meet the age requirements and it is also not a holiday -->

<!-- note && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first  -->

<!-- try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages -->
