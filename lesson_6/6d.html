<!-- imagine a amusement park that has a discount for childrens ( 6 years and younger ) or seniors ( 65 years and older) -->

<!-- create a variable age and save a person's age inside  -->

<!-- create a if statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount . if they do display discount in the console otherwise display no discount in the console
note : try to use the || operator in your solution  -->
<!-- try changing the age variable to display different messages -->
